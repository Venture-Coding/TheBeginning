# TheBeginning

In this repository I shall be including all the begineer level projects that I would complete in a day or two.
Currently it includes the following :

1) Virtual Assistant -
    This code causes a window to popup, the input to which is text or audio (after pressing enter).
    It finds related Wikipedia articles in the backend and outputs in another popup window. 
    All in all, a fun project to test WXpython's GUI and Google's Speech Recognition.
